# Serverless Ruby!

A Serverless Framework example using an AWS lambda which runs a Ruby function. Inspired by [serverless-php](https://github.com/ZeroSharp/serverless-php). 

This project demonstrates a few cool technlogies. Foremost is the amazing AWS Lambda. It's pretty exciting to see serverless architectures gaining adoption! Adding to the fun we have [serverless](https://serverless.com/), a framework for packaging and deploying across different providers including AWS, Google, and IBM. Also worth mentioning is the inclusion of Ruby. AWS Lambda supports a number of different languages natively, but Ruby is not one of them. Therefore we specially bundle the Ruby interpreter (courtesy of [Traveling Ruby](http://phusion.github.io/traveling-ruby/)) and wrap it in a Node.js script which executes it as a binary.

## Prerequsites

2. Create a new user `serverless` in AWS Console, download the `credentials.csv` file and setup provider: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSd9uYj2LJA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSd9uYj2LJA)
